# Route-planning-algorithm
Find the shortest route using Greedy and Djikstra algorithm (Route planner application)

This is the final project of SSK4106 Algorithm and Design Analysis.

The objective of the project is to use A* search, Djikstra's and Greedy algorithm to implement a "Google-maps" style route planning algorithm.

# Introduction
Technology has been helping us a lot, from sending email, text messaging, social media, and even maps. People use maps for many things, e.g., searching for places such as searching for the nearest restaurant, café, gas station, or finding direction from home to work. When requesting a route from one point to another location, usually, the result that comes out is the "shortest path" from starting point to destination point. 

The shortest path problem has been studied for many years. The shortest path problem is the problem that finds the minimum distance or pathway between nodes or vertices in a graph. A graph is an abstract mathematical object, which contains sets of vertices and edges. Shortest path problem is the problem of looking for the quickest way to get a route from one location to another . Expressed more formally, in a graph in which vertices are joined by edges and in which each edge has a value or cost, it is a problem of finding the lowest cost path between two vertices.

Many algorithms solve the shortest path problem. In this case, Dijkstra’s algorithm and Greedy algorithm have been chosen. Dijkstra’s algorithm includes a graph search algorithm used to solve the shortest path problem with a single source on a graph that does not have a negative side cost and produces the shortest path tree. This algorithm is often used in routing. The Greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment. The algorithm never reverses the earlier decision even if the choice is wrong. It gives solutions in an optimal way.This project will compare Dijkstra’s algorithm and Greedy algorithm to solve the shortest path problem by finding the optimum solution.

# Project content
Scenario:

Workshop is a place where most people search when having problems with their vehicle either required for service or towing. Therefore, to find the minimum distance of road from the broken car to the located workshop is the priority. Hence the road network is implemented to visualize all the roads to the workshop to find the most appropriate one. It is important to find the optimum solution as it can save time and solve the problem faster. Problems might arise if the problem is slow to resolve such as traffic congestion or in worse accidents could happen if other driver is not aware of the road surrounding.
