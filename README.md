# Route-planning-algorithm
Find the shortest route using Greedy and Djikstra algorithm (Route planner application)

This is the final project of SSK4106 Algorithm and Design Analysis.

The objective of the project is to use A* search, Djikstra's and Greedy algorithm to implement a "Google-maps" style route planning algorithm.
